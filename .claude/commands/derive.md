# Derive Comprehensive Analysis Report

You are tasked with completing or creating a comprehensive analysis report at: $ARGUMENTS

## Workflow

1. **Read the target file** to understand:
   - What questions/purpose is stated?
   - What references are cited?
   - What gaps need to be filled?

2. **Gather existing materials**:
   - Read all referenced notes and reports
   - Search for related materials in the knowledge base
   - Identify concepts needing deeper explanation

3. **Research online** for:
   - Technical definitions and explanations
   - Recent developments and implementations
   - Expert perspectives and tutorials

4. **Synthesize with visual clarity**:
   - Use ASCII diagrams for architecture and flows
   - Include pseudocode with parameter explanations
   - Create comparison tables for tradeoffs
   - Progress from high-level to detailed views

5. **Complete the report** by writing to the target file

## Output Requirements

- Clear multi-level explanations (infra → model → kernel)
- ASCII diagrams showing execution flows and timelines
- Pseudocode with key parameters annotated
- Design space analysis with tradeoffs
- Connections between theory and practice
