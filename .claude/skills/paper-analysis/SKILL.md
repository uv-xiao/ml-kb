# Paper Analysis Skill

Analyze research papers to extract key information, summarize contributions, and generate structured notes.

## When to Use

This skill auto-triggers when:
- Analyzing or summarizing a research paper
- Extracting key contributions, methods, or results
- Comparing findings across papers
- Creating literature review notes

## Capabilities

### Paper Summarization
Extract and structure:
- **Problem Statement**: What problem does the paper address?
- **Key Contributions**: Main innovations or findings
- **Methods**: Technical approach and algorithms
- **Results**: Experimental outcomes and benchmarks
- **Limitations**: Acknowledged weaknesses or gaps
- **Future Work**: Suggested directions

### Literature Synthesis
- Compare approaches across multiple papers
- Identify research trends and gaps
- Create topic taxonomies
- Build citation networks

### Output Formats

**Summary Note** (default):
```markdown
# Paper Title

## TL;DR
One-sentence summary

## Problem
What problem is being solved

## Contributions
- Contribution 1
- Contribution 2

## Method
Technical approach

## Results
Key findings

## Limitations
Weaknesses and gaps

## Related Work
Key citations
```

**Comparison Table**:
| Paper | Method | Dataset | Metric | Result |
|-------|--------|---------|--------|--------|

**BibTeX Entry**:
```bibtex
@article{...}
```

## Example Queries

- "Summarize the key contributions of this paper"
- "What methods does this paper use?"
- "Compare the results of papers A and B"
- "What are the limitations of this approach?"
- "Extract the related work citations"
- "Create a BibTeX entry for this paper"

## Best Practices

1. Provide the paper PDF, URL, or paste relevant sections
2. Specify the output format if needed
3. Ask follow-up questions for deeper analysis
4. Request specific sections (methods, results, etc.)
